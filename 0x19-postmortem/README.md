**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration**: 
  - Start Time: January 10, 2023, 09:30 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: January 10, 2023, 01:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**:
  - The service affected was our e-commerce website, resulting in a complete outage for approximately 20% of users, while another 30% experienced slow page loading times.
- **Root Cause**: 
  - The primary cause of the outage was a misconfigured load balancer that disrupted traffic routing.

**Timeline:**
- **Issue Detected**: 
  - January 10, 2023, 09:45 AM (UTC).
  - Discovered through a surge in user complaints and monitoring alerts indicating unusually high error rates.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Investigated application logs, server performance metrics, and database queries to identify bottlenecks.
  - Initially, we suspected a database issue and started optimizing SQL queries.
- **Misleading Paths**:
  - Misleadingly focused on database performance, which didn't resolve the issue.
- **Escalation**:
  - Escalated to the DevOps and Networking teams as the investigation revealed potential issues with the load balancer.
- **Resolution**:
  - Identified the root cause as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
  - Adjusted load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic, effectively restoring service.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause**:
  - The load balancer was not distributing traffic uniformly due to misconfigured routing rules. Some servers were overwhelmed, causing the outage.
- **Resolution**:
  - Reconfigured the load balancer to evenly distribute traffic based on server load and availability, resolving the issue.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement more comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems.
  - Develop a playbook for systematic troubleshooting, emphasizing early examination of the load balancer in case of similar incidents.
  - Conduct regular load testing and performance analysis to ensure the system can handle peak loads.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add auto-scaling capabilities to our infrastructure to adapt to fluctuating traffic.
  - Implement automated daily load balancer health checks.
  - Schedule periodic load balancer configuration reviews to prevent future misconfigurations.
  - Enhance communication between DevOps and Networking teams to streamline issue resolution.
